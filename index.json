Familiarize yourself with key terms and techniques. Reading Research Papers: Begin with seminal papers in the field of LLMs, such as the Transformer paper by Vaswani et al. (2017) and the BERT paper by Devlin et al. (2018). Online Courses: Enroll in online courses that cover deep learning and NLP, focusing on modules that discuss LLMs. Hands-On Practice: Implement simple models using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Start with basic neural networks and gradually move to more complex architectures. Building a Simple LLM: Attempt to build a simple LLM from scratch using a small dataset. This could involve tokenization, embedding layers, and attention mechanisms.
